Data analysis and basic machine learning prediction model to analyzed the cardiac patients dataset
patients

In the year 2020 the corona virus is outbreak and WHO declared it as a global pandemic in this pandemic condition 
almost all the doctors are helping the COVID-19 penitent and all the other diseases cases are set on the lower priority 
also at that time we can observed the global shortage of doctors and health workers. Also, the diseases like censors, kidney 
infection, heart diseases are also a needed to identify on early stage and cure as soon as possible to avoid more organa damage 
which lead to death. To identify the early-stage cardiac condition, we can utilise the modern AI and data driven based approach 
to predict the patient current condition and what sort of diseases they suffer through and based on the outcome we can priorates 
them to contact with the cardiac expert doctors.

## This data analysis is based on
-> Detailed data analysis study on the various factor which affected to leads the patient towards the serious cardiac conditions.
-> Process the collected dataset to create a better data statical analysis, and data visualisation.
-> Based on the data analysis selecte the machine learining model for the prediciton based on the patients data informaitons.
